I have created this website, after reviewing basics of React. That's why I didn't use complex or complicated stuffs while I am building this stunning application. Moreover the website is not responsive yet. I tried to create the website only using state and props. That's why you may encounter some prop drilling in the code.

Main functionalities of the website:
1) you can add items to the list or remove it from the list.
2) you can sort array according to three category
3) statisics is also shown of how many items you have packed and not packed.
4) you can clear all items at one time with clear functionality.
